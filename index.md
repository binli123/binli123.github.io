## About Me

I obtained his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was supervised by Dr Kevin Eliceiri. My research focuses on developing computational approaches to analyzing complex biological/histological image data for precision medicine. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Dr Jens Rittscher group at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford.

## Research Interests

- **Digital Pathology:** whole slide image analysis, computational histipathology
- **Machine Learning:** self-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning, generative models
- **Tissue Imaging:** tumor microenvironment, multiphoton microscopy, whole slide imaging

## News

- **[Aug. 2023]** Our paper about collagen fiber analysis and sythetic training data generation is accepted to Medical Image Analysis.
