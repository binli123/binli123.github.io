# About Me

I obtained my PhD from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I was supervised by [Prof Kevin Eliceiri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W86WgnQAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on developing computational approaches to analyzing complex biological/histological image and omics data for affordable precision medicine. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Prof Jens Rittscher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ED4V7hEAAAAJ&hl=en)'s research group at the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford. I work closely with [Dr Matthias Friedrich](https://www.expmedndm.ox.ac.uk/team/matthias-friedrich) on characterizing image biomarkers for Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
